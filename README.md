<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Implemented a CRUD based Web application (SPA) that allows you to create and/or enroll in courses. If you are a guest user, then you are limited to view only access of the top 3 courses. User features include registration, login, logout, create, read, update and delete. All user authentication is handled by the database using Mongoose.

## What I learned 
Taking my JavaScript knowledge and supercharging it (see list below) was an exciting challange that I enjoyed. All of these new aspects gave me individual challanges that I was able to overcome with my resourcefulness. I most enjoyed Mongoose and would say that understanding all the idiosyncrasies of Express slowed me down a bit. Utilizing JSON WebToken with database validation was very informative although at this point I feel that server side validation should be default in order to maximize database performance. After learning Handlebars, I personally chose to learn another templating engine. EJS was definitely more versitile and made easier with the use of snippets. This was a good introductory project to new frameworks and libraries. My Bootstap and CSS knowledge is getting better with each project that I complete. I enjoyed building this CRUD application.
