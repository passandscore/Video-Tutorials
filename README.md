Implemented a CRUD based Web application (SPA) that allows you to create and/or enroll in courses. If you are a guest user, then you are limited to view only access of the top 3 courses. User features include registration, login, logout, create, read, update and delete. All user authentication is handled by the database using Mongoose.
